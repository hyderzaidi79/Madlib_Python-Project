madlib = f"""Hello, my fellow {Plular_Noun} in 2020, it me, George Washingron, the first {Occupation}.I am writing from 
(the) {A_Place} where I have been secretly living for the past {Number} years. I am concerned by the {Adjective} state 
of affairs in America these days. It seems that your politicians are more concerned with {Verb_ing} one another than with
listening to the {Plular_Noun} of the people. When we declared our independence from (the) {A_Place}, we set forth on 
a/an {Adjective} path guided by the voices of the everyday {Plular_Noun}. If we're going to keep {Verb_ing}, then we need
to learn how to respect all {Plular_Noun}. Don't get me wrong; we had {Adjective} problems in my day, too. Benjamin 
Franklin once called me a/an {Noun} and kicked me in the {Part_of_Body}. But at the end of the day, we were able to {Verb}
in harmony. Let us find that {Adjective} spirit once again, or else I'm taking my {Part_of_Body} off the quarter!"""
