# Mad Libs Generator

This is a simple Python-based **Mad Libs Generator** that creates a humorous letter from "George Washington" based on user-provided inputs.

## Description

The program prompts the user to input different types of words (such as nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc.), and then inserts them into a predefined story template to generate a funny and personalized message.

## How It Works

1. The program asks for user input:
   - Plural noun
   - Occupation
   - A place
   - Number
   - Adjective
   - Verb ending with "ing"
   - Noun
   - Part of the body
   - Verb
   
2. Once all the inputs are provided, the program dynamically fills them into a letter
3. written from the perspective of George Washington.

4. Finally, it prints out the completed madlib story.

## Example

Enter a Plural noun: cats Enter an Occupation: baker Enter a Place: Paris Enter a Number: 
15 Enter an Adjective: silly Enter a Verb ending with 'ing': running Enter a Noun: 
watermelon Enter a Part of Body: elbow Enter a Verb: jump

### Output:

Hello, my fellow cats in 2020, it me, George Washingron, the first baker. I am writing from
(the) Paris where I have been secretly living for the past 15 years. I am concerned by the
silly state of affairs in America these days. It seems that your politicians are more
concerned with running one another than with listening to the cats of the people. When we
declared our independence from (the) Paris, we set forth on a/an silly path guided by the
voices of the everyday cats. If we're going to keep running, then we need to learn how to 
respect all cats. Don't get me wrong; we had silly problems in my day, too. Benjamin 
Franklin once called me a/an watermelon and kicked me in the elbow. But at the end of the
day, we were able to jump in harmony. Let us find that silly spirit once again, or else 
I'm taking my elbow off the quarter!
